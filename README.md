Snag this branch if you want the version of Deform that I'm actively developing.

This version is a complete rewrite, designed to make use of the new job system. It's much faster but takes a bit more work to extend. I'm still working on the underlying framework so the actual number of implemented deformers is way behing the main branch. However, if you're a proficient programmer, feel free to make your own deformers. Send them to me if you want to see them in the final product!
